 * 11.23) Yes they do form a Spanning tree however they do not produce a MST.
 *  The reason they do not produce a Minimum spanning tree is because when 
 *  running Dijkstra's algorithm it calculates the distance to each unvisited
 *  neighbor, and then updates the neighbors distance if smaller. The MST finds
 *  the minimal path First through unvisited neighbors.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 4) Recently in C343 we have been learning about Minimal Spanning Trees, and 
 * the shortest and longest path algorithms. These trees are made up of nodes and 
 * weighted paths that represent the distance to the next preceding node. Brain networks
 * are classified by the presence of nodes that lie central in the networks flow of
 * Information. In early RRMS patients have a normal network, high clustering of 
 * these nodes, and longer path lengths. Specialists had trouble creating graphs
 * of these hubs using unweighted/weighted graphs. They found that MST trees would
 * be the best way to represent these paths between nodes. Using MST tree allowed
 * the identification of critical nodes in a network that was directly correlated to
 * seizures.
